# MCElements
This is a minecraft mod based around magic. Yes, another one, shut up. There are several magic disciplines, which interract with each other at some points. Parallel to that classification, all magic is divided into elements, which have semi-independent progression trees and grant different abilities.

## Magical disciplines
### Alchemy
Alchemy is the art of brewing potions. Potions don't have a fixed recipe, rather they require a cauldron's contents to closely match attributes of the potion. That is achieved by adding *ingredients* and applying *activators*. Each ingredient has a shade of one alchemical aspect (rubedo, auredo, caerudo), possibly a specia effect (sparks, mist) and is sensitive to a single activator. By applying given activator (for example heat), the aspect of given ingredient becomes lighter and the special effect more powerful (some special effects exclude with each other). The alchemist can't directly see, which aspects the resulting mixture contains, only what color the potion has (which directly depends on aspects, however might require some practice to understand).

### Rune circles
Magical runes can be crafted from some special resources. When these runes are arranged in a closed circle, with a pattern of runes repeating all around the circle, the circle becomes active and provides some passive effect inside it's bounds. For example there might be a circle that makes blocks near unbreakable, regenerates health or increases loot drops from mobs.

### Spellcasting
Once player acquires knowlege of some aspect, he might cast a spell of that aspect. Spell is cast either with an empty hand, in which case the basic spell for given aspect is used, or with a special magical implement, which modifies the used spell (for example you might have an implement which, when used with "fire" aspect, produces some kind of a freezing spell). Casting a spell produces a spell charge in hand, which can then be used to apply the spell on ground, on self or on enemies.

## Nonmagical items
### Dagger
Dagger is the main entry point for this mod, allowing you to collect your first magical components. However, it also doubles as a potent combat weapon, as it applies bleeding on hit, and allows for stealth kills.
